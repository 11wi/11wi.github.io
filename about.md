Hello.

I'm Choi Won-il living in South Korea.
I graduated from Sungkyunkwan University with a bachelor's degree in statistics and currently works for GS SHOP AI/BlockChain R&D Center.
I have had experience with predictive modeling and optimization projects, and recently interested in home training and I want to be a data generalist and a singer-songwriter.
