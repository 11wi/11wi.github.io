Hello.

I'm Choi Won-il living in Sounth Korea.
I graduated from Sungkyunkwan University with a bachelor's degree in statistics and currently works for GSSHOP AI Center.
I have had experience with predictive modeling and scheduling optimization projects, and recently I am interested in home training and I want to be a data generalist and a singer-songwriter.
